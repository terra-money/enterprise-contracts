# Enterprise versioning contract

A contract for managing Enterprise's versions.

Serves as a global repository that maps Enterprise's versions to code IDs used for all DAO-specific contracts for that
Enterprise version.

Deploying a new Enterprise version is done essentially by adding a new version mapping here.

## Development

### Environment Setup

- Rust v1.44.1+
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Docker

1. Install `rustup` via https://rustup.rs/

2. Run the following:

```sh
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

### Unit / Integration Tests

Each contract contains Rust unit and integration tests embedded within the contract source directories. You can run:

```sh
cargo test
```

#### Compiling and building contracts

For production builds, run the following:

```sh
./build.sh
```

This performs several optimizations which can significantly reduce the final size of the contract binaries, which will
be available inside the `artifacts/` directory.

#### Faster builds for ARM

While developing and testing on Apple silicon or other ARM architectures, you can build contract .wasm files using:

```sh
./build_arm.sh
```

### Contract Deployment

Contracts have deployment scripts that make it easier to publish them to various networks.

#### Yarn + Terrariums setup

This assumes that you already have Yarn installed (https://yarnpkg.com/).

Once you clone the repository, you can do the following;

```
yarn install
```

We are using `terrariums` to manage contract deployment. The `terrarium.json` file allows the selection of a deployment
script. Deployment scripts are located in the `tasks` directory.

Terrariums synchronizes a `refs.json` file, that contains the `codeID` and `address` of deployed contracts on the
various networks.

#### terrarium.json setup

To run deployment scripts, you need to first generate your own `terrarium.json` file using the
provided `terrarium-template.json`.

To do that, simply replace the signers' mnemonics to one of your wallets, for the networks you plan to use.

After that, just rename `terrarium-template.json` to `terrarium.json` and you're ready to run the deployment scripts.

#### Running the deployment scripts

To deploy a contract, you can run the following command:

```
yarn deploy:<contract>:<mainnet|testnet|staging|cradle>
```

Enterprise factory testnet:

```
yarn deploy:enterprise-factory:testnet
```

Enterprise factory mainnet:

```
yarn deploy:enterprise-factory:mainnet
```

#### Deployment sequence

The contracts have certain interdependencies that require specific sequence in contract deployment.

The correct deployment sequence:

1. enterprise-versioning (global instance)
2. enterprise-factory (global instance)
3. enterprise-facade (global instance)
4. New Enterprise version (will deploy code for each of the DAO-specific contracts, and package them into a version
   denoted in the `tasks/deploy_enterprise_versioning.ts` file).

#### Running the migration scripts

To migrate a contract, you can run commands similar to deployment, however you will use `migrate` instead of `deploy`:

```
yarn migrate:<contract>:<mainnet|testnet|staging|cradle>
```

Enterprise factory testnet:

```
yarn migrate:enterprise-factory:testnet
```

### Cradle tests

A suite of tests using [NewMetric's](https://www.newmetric.xyz/) Cradle has been created, and can be found
under [tests-cradle/](./tests-cradle).

#### Purpose

The tests are designed to execute real transactions on a fork of mainnet.

These are used as 'smoke tests' for new versions of Enterprise. They allow developers to exactly simulate existing DAOs
upgrading to new versions and check whether basic functions (like proposals, or upgrading again) work, so that DAOs are
not bricked after an update.

#### Env setup for Cradle tests

To run the tests, an `.env` file in the root directory of the repository is required.

The file requires the following setup:

```
NETWORK=<mainnet|testnet>
LCD_ENDPOINT=<Cradle LCD endpoint, can be found in your Cradle dashboard>
JWT_TOKEN=<JWT token for your Cradle session>
CHAIN_ID=<e.g. phoenix-1>
MNEMONIC_KEY=<mnemonic of the wallet used to interact with the chain>
```

#### Running Cradle tests

Before running Cradle tests, you need a valid setup in the form of an `.env` file, described above.

To run the tests, run:

```sh
yarn tests-cradle
```
